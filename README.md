# CPP-Mastery-Journey
A collection of C++ Problems and projects solved during my software engineering path

Welcome to my repository! This is a Collection of problems and projects I am Working on whihle learning C++ with 
**Dr. Mohammed Abu-HadHoud**. My goal is to build a solid foundation in software Engineering.

## 📁 Project : Seconds to task Duration This Program takes a total number of seconds as input and converts it into a human-readable
format: **Days : Hours : Minuites : Seconds**.

### ✨ Key Features:
* **Structured Data:** Used  'Struct'  to group time units together.
* **Input Validation:** Ensured  eethe user enters positive numbers only.
* **Clean Code:** Divided the logic into three separate funtions (Read, Calculate, Print).
* **Mthematical logic:** Applied the modulo operator '%' and division '/' to handle time conversion.
  ### 🛠️ How to Run:
  1. Copy The Code From
     'Seconds-To-Duration.cpp'.
  2. Paste it into any C++ Compiler (Like Cxxdroid or Visual Studio).
  3. Enter the total seconds and see the magic!
 
  *"Success is the sum of small efforts,
  repeated day in and day out."*
